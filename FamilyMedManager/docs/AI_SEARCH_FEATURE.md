### Key Services

#### AIService
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- Structured prompt building
- Response validation and enhancement
- Fallback response system
- Error handling with retry logic

#### LoggingService
- AsyncStorage-based logging
- Search history tracking

### Data Types
- `AISearchInput`: User input structure
- `AISearchResponse`: AI response format
- `MedicationRecommendation`: Medication suggestions
- `FirstAidInstruction`: Step-by-step guidance
- `AISearchLog`: Interaction logging format

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Dependencies Added
- No additional dependencies required

### API Integration
- Uses native fetch API for OpenAI integration (React Native compatible)
- No additional OpenAI SDK dependencies required

### Logging
- Uses in-memory logging for interaction tracking
- Logs are preserved during app session but reset on app restart
- Can be upgraded to persistent storage (AsyncStorage) if needed

## Usage Instructions

1. **Access**: Tap the search icon in the main header
2. **Symptoms**: Select one or more symptoms from the grid
3. **Patient**: Choose Adult or Child
4. **Severity**: Select Mild, Moderate, or Severe
5. **Context**: Optionally add additional details (can skip)
6. **Results**: Review AI recommendations and first aid instructions
7. **Complete**: Confirm to return to dashboard

## Error Handling

- **No API Key**: Falls back to sample recommendations
- **API Failure**: Provides fallback response with retry option
- **Network Issues**: Graceful error messages with retry functionality
- **Invalid Input**: Form validation prevents invalid submissions

## Testing

### Validation Script
Run `node scripts/validateAISearch.js` to test:
- AI service functionality
- Logging service operations
